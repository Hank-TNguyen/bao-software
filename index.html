            <h3>Be Candid & Pragmatic</h3>
            <p>This image of my wife and I was taken in Jan 2024.</p>
            <p>We're partner. When it comes to problem solving, objectively describing the problem is essential. Then we, together, will work out a simple and appropriate solution.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="story2" class="image-story-content" style="display:none;">
            <h3>Have Win-Win mentality</h3>
            <p>This image was taken during rush hour in a subway station in Thailand, Feb 2024.</p>
            <p>I don't believe in zerosum game. If I can help your business, I will do it the best way I can. When time comes, our relationship will reward me accordingly.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="story3" class="image-story-content" style="display:none;">
            <h3>Be open-minded & dive deep</h3>
            <p>This image was taken from inside of the Washington State Capitol building, Mar 2024.</p>
            <p>The image is indeed upside down. At first glance, we probably wouldn't notice it. We can't always avoid overlooking things. It's best to be open-minded, seek to understand the problem deeply and try different angles when looking at a problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="story4" class="image-story-content" style="display:none;">
            <h3>Strive for Efficiency</h3>
            <p>I came from a rural area in Vietnam. This photo was taken during my visit in Jan 2024.</p>
            <p>The tale of the wooden fish is humble, yet belieing a sense of pride. When in poverty, the people often hang up the wooden fish at the 'meal area'. This way, they can eat their meal and imagine eating the fish.</p>
            <p>Respect the past, I strive for efficiency, always try to do more with less.</p>
